sample SF App

Two objects: List(a shopping list) and Items (shopping items on the list).

When you select an item (e.g.:soap) the trigger adds relateditems to the list (based on the custom setting data). 

A custom button 'Add Item' when clicked displays VF pop-up page with list of items and checkboxes. 

When you select or unselect them and hit save you can see that the logic closes the pop-up window and refreshes 
the main window to display the updates to the isSelected checkbox on the Item record associated to that List object.
